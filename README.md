# Image Classification API with FastAPI

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a Logistic Regression model built using PyTorch, served through a FastAPI application. The model predicts digits (0-9) based on images provided by the user through a simple web interface. Users can upload an image, and the model returns the digit prediction.

This project is a REST API built using FastAPI for classifying images using a pre-trained Logistic Regression model. The model predicts the class of an image, such as those from the MNIST dataset.

## Running the Code Locally

### Prerequisites
1. Python 3.8 or higher
2. torch for model training and inference
3. fastapi for building the API
4. uvicorn for running the FastAPI server
5. pillow for image processing
6. python-multipart for handling file uploads

## Features
- Upload an image (28x28 grayscale) to get a prediction.
- Model trained with PyTorch and served using FastAPI.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- `pip` (Python package manager)
