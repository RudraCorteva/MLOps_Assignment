# Image Classification API with FastAPI

This project is a REST API built using FastAPI for classifying images using a pre-trained Logistic Regression model. The model predicts the class of an image, such as those from the MNIST dataset.

## Features
- Upload an image (28x28 grayscale) to get a prediction.
- Model trained with PyTorch and served using FastAPI.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- `pip` (Python package manager)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
